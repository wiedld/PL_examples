Since July 2017, been employed fulltime as a Software Engineer in private repos not hosted on github (i.e. bitbucket, gitlab).

Here is example code from a few courses taken in spare time. Not inclusive -- as we are not supposed to post course code.

Feel free to test me on my day job. All the things.
